          <p>PC gaming is quite different from consoles, as your mileage with each game on this list will vary based on your rig. That said, many of the games on this list don't require the latest and greatest graphic cards--they merely help these great games look even better. And if you happen to have a Steam Deck, a lot of these games are playable on Valve's impressive handheld PC. We have a separate list of Steam Deck recommendations for games that play great there. We regularly reevaluate and update this list, so you can always use it as a resource to find some fresh recommendations.</p>

                  with the same complex characters and detailed world to
                  explore, but with improved graphics and the option to add Red
                  Dead Redemption 2 mods that let you skip the prologue,
                  transform into an animal, or turn Arthur into the Joker.

                  Some Call of Duty games are clearly better than others, and
                  this year's iteration, Black Ops 6, is the best the series has
                  been in some time. The campaign is a smart and varied action
                  spectacle that keeps you on your toes as it explores paranoid
                  thriller tropes set against global events in the 1990s.
                  Meanwhile, the multiplayer's new omni-movement makes matches

                  Cyberpunk 2077 had a divisive launch that by all accounts
                  failed to live up to the lofty expectations placed on it. But
                  CD Projekt Red didn't abandon the game, instead issuing a
                  steady stream of updates culminating in September 2023's
                  massive 2.0 update that overhauls many major systems, while
                  also integrating the new Phantom Liberty DLC. The Cyberpunk of
                  today is a sharper, more focused action-RPG with a greater
                  variety of skills that let you navigate Night City your own
                  way.

                <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ color: "text.secondary" }}>
                  The initial response to Valorant was that it's basically a
                  mashup where Overwatch meets Counter-Strike--and yeah, that's
                  pretty accurate. That's also a good thing, because Valorant
                  draws on many of the strengths of those games to make
                  something unique. It focuses on the round-based
                  demolition-style game mode with two teams of five (attackers
                  and defenders) on balanced maps with specific lanes and
                  sightlines and an extremely fast time-to-kill.

                  Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine was a cult classic when it

                  has delivered just what fans of the bone-crunching action
                  series have been waiting for. That means a return to the
                  bloody, brutal combat from the first game, but with

                  Capcom's venerable Resident Evil series has been progressively
                  producing remakes of its classic library, but none of them
                  held the expectations and weight of Resident Evil 4. It's long
                  been regarded as one of the best survival-horror games of all
                  time, and a trendsetter for the action-focused style of the
                  genre. Capcom approached this remake especially cautiously,
                  giving it a light touch of upgrades that make the whole
                  experience feel modern without losing its soul.
